Hola amigos, I am a 2nd-year PhD Student at the University of Trento, Italy 🇮🇹🤌 

**What do I do?** Supervised by prof. Elisa Ricci, my research interests mostly include Vision-Language Models and the intersection between model generalization and other sub-fields. Recently, I have been working on the Test-Time Generalization of VLMs. Who knows what will happen next (if you do, pls tell me).

**What do I really do?** Enough with the research. In my free time, I love playing football (I'm Italian after all ⚽️), table tennis 🏓 and, in general, exercising. I used to read often and I'm trying to restore this habit. I also do not *totally* dislike a night out partying with friends (just saying...).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
